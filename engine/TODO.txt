- Systems should be able to register and call events
- Assert -> better string format support
- GL objects dont check binds before binding themselves, or do any unsettings / bind undos (Not sure if needed)
- Not sure if texture slots work as intended, need to test
- Sprite drawing order is based on sorting order, causes flickering when drawing new objects
