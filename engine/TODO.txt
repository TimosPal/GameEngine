Layers system + ECS:
Currently the engine does not utilize layers for rendering input handling etc
- Add a Rendering Layer
- Add an Input Layer
- Split systems per layer
- Systems should be able to register and call events

Assert -> better string format support


GL objects dont check binds before binding themselves, or do any unsettings / bind undos
(Not sure if needed)
